# Team Development, Personal Projects, and N.L.S.
The third part of the course will have three focuses in parallel:
* _Group Development_ - Over the course of 3-4 weeks practice planning, developing, testing, deploying, and maintaining a webapp in a small team.  You will explore modern management and testing paradigms.  You will also learn to use GitHub's collaboration features to coordinate your efforts, host documentation, and publicise your project.
* _Personal Projects_ - Complete your own personal project.  You have the choice to down two paths: Developer or Entrepreneur.  If you want to go the Dev route you will work with the Coding Mentors to plan and build an app that will stretch your development skills to the edge.  If you want to go the Entrepreneur route you will work with Juan to perfect your business plan, pitch, landing page, marketing strategy, and plan an MVP.  You are free to create your own hybrid track too. Want a complete MVP + landing page _and_ a business plan but no marketing strategy?  Go for it.
* _N.L.S._ - Explore a variety of advanced development tools and concepts including REACT, immutable data flow, advanced architectures, deployment tools, relational databases, and more.  (see below)
