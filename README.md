####Hi!

This is the main curriculum repository for the Fullstack September Cohort.  
There are several components to the curriculum:
* [A gitbook schedule](https://eliumacademy.github.io/Sepco/) organized by week.  You will follow along on this gitbook to know what's coming week-by-week and day-by-day.  A week's page will include an overview, links to each day's lessons, and links to that week's projects'.
* [A wiki](https://github.com/EliumAcademy/Sepco/wiki) for you, the students.  We have gotten a little start on each page, the rest is in your hands. Use this wiki to collaboratively build a study guide to accompany this course.
* [JankeLearning](https://github.com/jankeLearning). This Github organization hosts all of our programming content - markdown lessons, code to study, and projects.
* [Google Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/0BwhXCWJ484CCOGZTWHZWTHZQaG8) with all of the business content. 
* [Events Planning](https://github.com/EliumAcademy/Sepco/projects/1?) and [Events Calendar](https://www.google.com/calendar).  If you're all motivated enough to organize events, we'll help you host them!  
* [The Markdown Source Code](https://github.com/EliumAcademy/Sepco/tree/master) for the gitbook and this readme. 
 
Ideas for new lessons?  Projects? Resources?  Let us know with an issue, pull request, or post in the wiki!
